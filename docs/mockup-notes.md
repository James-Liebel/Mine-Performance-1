# Mockup notes — Mine-Performance-1 (Conversion-first)

## What this theme communicates

- **Clarity and trust:** Light background, high contrast, readable text. Parents and decision-makers can scan quickly and feel confident.
- **Action-oriented:** Strong primary CTA color (blue), obvious “Get Started” / “Book Evaluation” hierarchy. Buttons and links stand out.
- **Friendly and approachable:** Clean sections, simple layout, minimal visual noise. No dark or “edgy” feel.

## Who it appeals to

- **Parents** looking for a safe, credible academy for their athlete.
- **Buyers** who want to understand offerings and next steps without digging.
- **Conversion-focused** stakeholders who care about sign-ups and bookings over brand drama.

## Pages to demo first (and why)

1. **Home** — Hero and trust strip; CTA above the fold. Shows conversion-first layout and CTA hierarchy.
2. **Start / member-registration** — Where “Get Started” leads; clear path to evaluation/booking.
3. **Contact** — Primary conversion endpoint; form and CTA prominence.
4. **Programs** — How programs are presented simply with clear CTAs.

## Brand

- Same “Mine Performance” baseball academy brand as MP2 and MP3; only the **presentation** (conversion-first) differs.
