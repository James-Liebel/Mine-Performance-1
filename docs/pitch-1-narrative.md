# Pitch #1 — Conversion-First Marketing Site

## Problem

The current Mine Performance Academy experience lives on StatStak’s platform. While StatStak handles booking, leaderboards, and athlete data well, the site often feels like a generic facility template: unclear value proposition, weak calls to action, and limited trust signals. Parents deciding whether to buy training, athletes looking for the right program, and coaches/recruiters looking at data don’t get a clear, credible “front door” that guides them to the next step.

## Solution

A **new, standalone marketing site** (Next.js) that serves as the main front door: clean, premium, conversion-focused. It keeps StatStak as the engine for bookings, events, and leaderboards but drives traffic there through clear CTAs and deep links. The new site delivers:

- **Clear above-the-fold message:** One headline, one value prop, and two CTAs (e.g. “Book evaluation” + “Start here”).
- **Guided path:** A “Start here” wizard (goal → age → availability) that recommends a program and links to booking.
- **Trust and proof:** Programs, coaches, facility photos, testimonials, results/leaderboard highlights, and FAQ.
- **Consistent experience:** Design system, mobile-first layout, and a primary CTA on every page.

## Benefits

- **Higher conversions:** Parents and athletes know exactly what to do next (book, join, register, contact).
- **Stronger brand:** A distinct, professional presence instead of a one-size-fits-all template.
- **Better SEO and performance:** Dedicated metadata, sitemap, JSON-LD, and a fast, lightweight front end.
- **Preserved functionality:** All StatStak features remain available via deep links; no loss of booking or data.

## Proof points

- **Audit and IA:** Crawl and audit of the current site informed UX, copy, and conversion gaps; a clear IA and user journeys are documented.
- **Design system:** Tokens and components (e.g. buttons, cards, spacing) are defined and implemented for consistency and accessibility.
- **Implementation:** Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Tailwind, and a server-safe content layer; all required pages (Home, Programs, Coaches, Events, Results, Facility, About, Contact, FAQ, Start) are built and building successfully.
- **Launch readiness:** Launch checklist covers content, SEO, links, Lighthouse targets, and analytics so the site can go live with confidence.
